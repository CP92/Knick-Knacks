## About me mod

This is a mod for the game Minecraft. The purpose of this mod is to add blocks or items in a low tech fashion that I believe could be of use to myself (and potentially others) in conjunction with other mods.

## Current blocks/items being worked on:

Salty Sand: This block exists to allow the user to aquire the salt item. This block is generated in the world around sand and at 25% rate, and there is an increased rate of spawn in beach and ocean biomes. 

Salt pile: This items can be aquired by breaking salty sand blocks and is used in the salting barrel.

Salt block: This is the block form of the salt pile, crafted by spreading out 9 salt piles in the crafting table. Also used in the salting barrel.

The salting barrel: The intent of this block is to allow players to dry items into other items. Currently the only use is to turn the rotten flesh item into the leather item. This blocks functions like a vanilla furnace, you insert salt into the bottom fuel slot and place input items into the top slot and after a certain amount of time the output will be place on the right.

The pestle and mortar: This item is to be used in the crafting grid with ore blocks such as iron, gold etc. The purpose of this is to grind the ore into 2 dust, and each dust will produce one ingot of the corresponding metal when placed in the furnace, essentially doubling the ingot output. This item, and any varients that may exist in the future will have a durability that will destroy the item when used up.

### This mod is currently unreleased and is actively being developed.
